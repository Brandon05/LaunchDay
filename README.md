# Launch Day

**Launch Day** is an iOS app that allows a gamer to search and find video games that are currently out or track games that are yet to release.  The user can keep a wish list of games that includes games they might have pre-ordered to get real time notifications on release information (or price info TBD). Also, looking to integrate apple watch support to be able to view/edit wishlist from the apple watch.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Allow gamers to search an expansive database of games
- [ ] Allow gamers to track unreleased games and stay up to date on release info (push notifications)
- [ ] View wishlist
- [ ] Post to cloud backend (Parse/FireBase)
- [ ] 


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [ ] User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count.
- [ ] User can pull to refresh.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):
